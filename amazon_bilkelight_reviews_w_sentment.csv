1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the rear light plugged in and charging a couple nights ago when without a sound or warning a column of flame three feet high shot up out of the device. It quickly reduced to about four inches high and with several attempts I was then able to blow out the fire.Thank God I was there in the room at the time. It happened to be about 1am at the time and it very easily could have burned down my house with me and my family in it.My guess is the lithium battery exploded, but there is no doubt it was faulty.","Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2020",241 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9872524738311768

  Â So far so good with these lights. The blinking function on the headlight is illuminating every street sign, stop sign, and even license plates in my path, and it's making me pretty visible out there. One car even flashed their brights at me lol. The taillight I attached to the seat stay part of the back of the frame and cars are giving me a lot of room. The quick release is easy for the headlight, it takes a bit of tugging with the rear light, but both are working fine. Look at the video to gauge brightness while they are blinking (there are other settings). The price is pretty good with these, if you're on the fence, get them.","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2018",280 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9912276864051819
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The lights seem to be great, but the mounting bracket doesn't fit on my road bike handlebars, rendering the white light useless for me.  I measured the middle section of the handlebar and it's 4"" circumference. The bracket does not close and secure.So, I'll be returning and purchasing a different product. I have a Specialized Dolce women's road bike.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2018",125 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.987389326095581
4.0 out of 5 stars,"*UPDATE*I was contacted by seller who offered a replacement light set. The new style bracket is much better. The rubber bracket is easier to attach and stretches to my new larger diameter handlebars. It seems like it will hold the light fine. I have only done a test ride and have not taken a long ride yet. Very pleased with the excellent customer service and new style bracket. THANKS!*ORIGINAL REVIEW*I had these on my old road bike for a couple of months and they worked pretty well. Bright and easy to recharge. I bought a new bike and wanted to move them but the bracket for the front light was too small for the new handlebars. The bracket is hard plastic not rubber like in the product picture. I was able to get it to stay with zip ties but during the ride the screw that holds the light to the bracket fell off and the light went flying off into the street . Goodbye light, not even going to stop and pick you up. I still have the rear light. It fits well on the stem but cannot be mounted on an under saddle bag.","Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2019",81 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9918314814567566
3.0 out of 5 stars,"They are bright and easy to put on, but both lights have similar issues.  I can't activate the buttons with my fingers, I have to use a pointy object. I've been using a house key to push the buttons because the switch is recessed too far into the body of the lights that my finger tips can't push them far enough to activate the switch.  Both rear and front.Both lights shift around while riding too, the front light strap doesn't have enough traction to keep it fixed in position so with every bump it moves either up or down.  The rear light moves a little bit too, but not as much as the front light.  I have to re-aim the headlight after every speed bump or curb I go over, and they would be useless on a night off road trail.  If I stretch the strap tighter to the next notch I think it would break.  I have ordered a bigger diameter handlebar and stem, so maybe the light will stay better fixed on the new handlebar.For $14 I am not terribly concerned about it, as I primarily bought these so the cops don't ticket me for riding at night without lights.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the cheapest headlight and taillight combo on the market. It's hard to beat at this price point. The headlight is bright and rechargeable. The taillight helps the overall experience. They were very generous with the cables by giving me 2 instead on 1. Instructions were very clear as well. Came in good packaging and was all protected with foam. Not bad for $12. The beam is cool white. Battery life is impressive. After a few years, I'm am still getting 6 hours of life on high. I highly recommend this headlight to anyone who doesn't like to deal with batteries and are on a budget.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2018",141 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9899203777313232

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Took a chance on a cheap light, and it's worked out. Compared with a light that I know to be 200lm, this one is maybe a little brighter, 250lm at least. So the claimed 300lm is certainly plausible. The tail light is pretty nice considering how much this kit costs.My gripe is that the light has to cycle through all modes, and can't work any other way. So you can't toggle between low and high while riding, you need to cycle through flash and off. The light also shipped with the battery at 0 charge, which is a no for lithium batteries.But the light is bright as claimed, and the build quality is ok. I'd probably buy again.","Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2019",48 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.990840494632721
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I REALLY wanted to like this headlight--and potentially there was I lot I COULD have liked about it--but ultimately, if you can't get the battery / charging system right on something like this, it's a waste of time and money.I bike a LOT... and I've owned many different bike headlights over the years.  So I have a bit of experience in these things.  (Or, to put it another way, I don't feel like I have unrealistic expectations--and I have a pretty extensive frame of reference when comparing and contrasting cycling head-lights and tail-lights.)  This set came with both a head-light and a tail-light--and since the tail-light so far seems to be operating fairly typically, I am mainly speaking here about the head-light.For the price, I liked a lot of things about this product.  It was reasonably bright.  The mounting system was good and easy to use.  And it had the basic light modes you want / need when riding at night.  The main problem is the battery.  I don't know if these just have a bad switch--that is allowing voltage to drain the battery when not in use--or if the batteries are just cheap junk.  But there is very little ""stand-by"" time with this head-light.  Meaning you have to keep it plugged in / charging right up until you need to use it--or the charge drains out too quickly--even when not in use.For example, say you are going on a road trip and you want to bring your bike--but you might not be riding it for a day or two into the road trip.  You pack up all of your cycling gear--charge up the batteries on your garmin, your head light, and your tail light--and take it all with you.  A couple of days later, when you are ready to ride--you pull everything out and mount it to the bike and head out in the afternoon for a 2 or 3 hr ride--which brings you back at night.  But, despite the fact that your head light was fully charged when you took it off the charging cable--two or three days ago--and you have not used it at all since--when you turn it on, it either dies fairly quickly--or already completely dead.  A well designed and fabricated battery operated device should have a reasonably long standby time--so that when you're ready to use it--the batteries are still holding their charge.Another example with this light:  I charge it fully, go out for a ride--say, for 1 hr--and I use the light the entire time.  I turn it off when I get back home and leave the light on my bike--for the next ride.  The manufacturer claims this light should last for FIVE HOURS on full bright without needed to be recharged.  Which means that I should have FOUR hours left on the batteries at full bright for my next ride.  However, even if I ride the next day or within a couple of days, this light is always DEAD when I try to use it a second time without re-charging.(FYI - I just tested / timed how long this light works on a full charge at full brightness--and it was only about 3 hrs... NOT even CLOSE to the 5 hrs that they claim here in Amazon.  Which certainly does not surprise me given the other batter issues I've had.)So, in my experience with these types of things, that means either the power switch is bad--and the bulb is bleeding a tiny amount of power from the battery even when in the ""off"" position--or the batteries or charging system are no good--or a combination of the three.I bought this light mainly because it was small and easily / USB rechargeable--and easy to mount and dis-mount to switch between various bikes (because I have many, many bikes).  I already have some bigger / brighter / heavier lights--that are more complicated to mount and dismount--if I really need to light up the night.  But since I can't trust the battery / standby life on this light, it renders it much less useful overall.I bought this to replace  a Cycle Torch light I used for quite a while--that I loved--that fell off my bike and got run over in traffic before I could safely get back to it on the road.  I almost wanted to cry when that happened--because that was almost the perfect bike headlight.  However it is nearly 2x more expensive than this Ascher--though also 200 lumens brighter (I think).  (I can't find a specific lumens claim for this headlight in the Amazon listing details... but when I searched the ""Q/A section just above the Reviews, someone answered that the headlight was 300 lumens; the Cycle Torch Shark is stated at 500 lumens on Amazon.)  Though the battery life on the cycle torch was definitely getting weaker over time (I had it / used it for many years)... I never had this problem of it going completely dead in a day or two if not used--after fully charged.  Even the brand new Cycle Torch on eBay only claims a TWO hour run time on ""high""... which is honestly pretty similar to what I was getting / expecting from my +/- 5 yr old version.  And, compared to the only +/- 3 HR run time for this Ascher head-light... which is supposedly 200 lumens less... 3 hrs sounds about right.  (I never believed the 5 HR claim.)So, right now I'm trying to figure out exactly how to contact the seller to file a warranty claim for this head-light.  They don't SPECIFICALLY mention a warranty period or process ANYWHERE on this Amazon page for the product.  But I'll try contact them directly to see what they say... if that is even possible.  (Update: Turns out it is not possible at all.  Essentially, the ONLY warranty / returns availalbe on this light are during the initial 30 day period after you purchase it--that virutally ALL items purchased on Amazon have.  So, be aware when you buy this headlight that if it fails after just 30 days... you're out of luck.  Thanks, Amazon.)","Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2020",23 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9886218905448914

I am only riding one hour per day currently and it lasts 2.5 rides......when I start long rides again, it will not last the ride.I really like the fact you dont need screw drivers and spacers like most lights.  Since it attaches with a rubber strap it forms to any shape.  It is also bright and it took one spill and still works.  I have other more high priced lights and these seem to work as well.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am amazed with this light set. The headlight is ridiculously bright. I usually keep it down on the dimmer setting to save battery and for being seen and not to blind oncoming traffic, but if you need extra light to see further and ride faster it's got it. âI actually use it as a flashlight more than I do for riding. Just pop it off the mount and use it for whatever. I live by the water and it's even bright enough to use as a spotlight for boating. In the pic, that tree in the center is 60 feet away and you can see how bright it is in pitch dark with no other lights nearby.The mounting system is super easy and functional and you can put them almost anywhere you want on the bike. The taillight can be mounted in 90 degree increments in any direction so you can mount it on a vertical or horizontal bar. I've had them in the rain and there is no problem with water resistance. The charge ports have rubber seals that you close when not charging. The batteries last longer than I've tested. I charge them after a few rides so I actually don't know how much longer they last. More than enough for my needs.I will be buying more. I would like it better with just hi-lo-off or separate on-off and mode switches so you don't have to click through the four modes to turn off. No need for the flashing modes. That would make it more convenient for flashlight use as well. Great job, Ascher.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2021",No Data,1,POSITIVE,0.9916189908981323

I have a basket on the back so the tail light attaches to a length of pvc pipe.  The same size elastic band works here, too.  The lights are easy to turn on and off, much easier than my last pair.

This item came packaged in a paperboard box, wrapped in plastic, with a plastic insert, making recycling more challenging.

I recommend these to anyone commuting before or after daylight hours. They are easy to install/remove with a strap that wraps around your bike handlebars or seat post. And you can remove the lights from the strap mount with a quick detach clip. Both the front and rear lights have 4 modes: bright-constant on, slightly dimmed-constant on, bright-slow flashing, bright-quick flashing.

One is still running strong to this day, but the other one stops holding charge in the battery after about 6 months or so (the light still works otherwise).Another super annoyance is one of the mounting systems is a bit loose.

Lit up my entire room, and the reflection off the white walls has burned my cornias. After my vision came back, I tested at night time. I now know I can literally see about 6 miles ahead of me. I turned on the strobe mode and started having a seizure. If you want something that can see clear to your mom's house, pick this up. But if you like your eye balls, get something with less power.","Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9884088635444641
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far,  I am impressed. Arrived quickly and the packaging was very nice. I really like the ease of the mounting system of both lights. Rear light charged in about an hour, but the front headlight took over four hours to charge. The rear light has the capability of mounting vertical or horizontal, thatâs a nice feature. I just got these lights and havenât used them enough for a proper review. I will update after having used them a bit longer. So far these are much better than I expected.","Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2019",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9917294383049011
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Itâs not bad, it does the job, but it could be brighter.I am a very casual bike ride are usually just ride with my family.I got this light to test it out and see if I would order more for the rest of my family.Becomes well packaged and with everything you need to get going.Battery seems to last but it gets very dim within about 20 to 30 minutes.I believe I read that the highest output was 300 lm and I donât think itâs 300 lm, I could be wrong but whatever it starts out at within 20 to 30 minutes it probably Dems down about 50%.The construction is a hard plastic and it seems sturdy enough. The installation is extremely easy and so is recharging.The best part about this light is the tail light that came with it. Itâs extremely bright flashing red light can be seen very easily down the street and it to is rechargeable.I ordered a different headlight that also came with a tail light but that tail light is not rechargeable, however the other light does stay brighter longer.Iâm still within the return window so I might return this one to get the other one.But all in all itâs not a bad product.","Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2020",No Data,1,POSITIVE,0.9854044318199158

Bike shop wanted $40 for a basic rechargeable light set, that wasn't nearly as bright as this.  So for $17 its  pretty decent, and it might be pretty pricy to get something that is functionally an upgrade.

I was a bit nervous about rubber straps to hold the lights on, but appear to be durable and don't show any signs of breaking.  Both lights come off and back on the bike really easily.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the second pair of lights I've tried, and they work GREAT.  The rear light has incredible battery life.  I've used it on multiple century rides (around 6-7 hrs) and it holds power the entire time, amazingly enough.  (When set to the flashing mode.)The front light holds battery well enough, but not nearly as long because it definitely puts out a higher luminescence.  I've used it on night rides and foggy mornings and it works great.  I can see well enough in front of me to avoid obstacles in the road.What's really cool about these lights is the size (very small and light), the battery life, and the ability to angle the mounts up and down.  This is especially helpful for the front light because you can either aim it straight (so cars can see you) or toward the ground (when night riding/to avoid obstacles), and you don't need multiple mounts to do this.  Highly recommend. :)","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2021",No Data,1,POSITIVE,0.9896089434623718

It won't hold a charge anymore after just 4.5 months of daily use, so it doesn't turn on anymore.Before then, I was happy with them--bright, easy to recharge, easy to put on and take off the brackets. The only thing I didn't like about them before the white one died is the mount for the white light - it doesn't grip the front bar hard enough to keep the white light in place. Because it's heavier, the white light would always slip so it was pointing down whenever I hit a bump or something. It's easy enough to fix by just readjusting it with my hand, but not always very convenient in the middle of a ride, especially if there is traffic around or the road is uneven.","Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2021",No Data,1,POSITIVE,0.9912285804748535

Both were charged overnight.","Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2021",No Data,1,POSITIVE,0.9930406808853149
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We purchased 3 of these lighting systems in the past for for 2 bicycles I have and one my wife has.  I have used one of my bikes to ride daily to early coffee with my friends before the sun comes up so a  good lighting system is really nice to have.  Recently I rode one of my bikes with the system on it on an unpaved trail during the day with some moderate bumps.  Somewhere on that trip my front headlight slipped off of its slide on mounting.  I didnât see it happen, just one moment on the ride it was there and then after a while I noticed it was gone.  I do really like these lighting systems so I purchased another one recently (the one related to your message below) to replace the light that slipped off.  In the future I will leave the front light off of its mounting until I need it.  You make a fine product at a reasonable price.  I would recommend your lighting system to anyone.","Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2020",No Data,1,POSITIVE,0.9877365827560425

Not only where there no gutters but the only possible explanation as to where this ended up that I could come up with is that it somehow took a hard bounce up into the chassis of the ford taurus i spent 20 minutes looking under.As far as a light goes it's bright AF, but I only was able to use it once before it fell off my bike and seemingly bounced into a wormhole so -2 stars for that but the rear light is still holding strong.","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2020",No Data,1,POSITIVE,0.9860931634902954

  Â This light system is just what I was looking for (A bike store nearby sold this same set for over $100). I bike a lot at night because I live near my job and work the later shift (usually getting off between 7-9pm). Mounting was easy breezy, all light modes work on both of my lights. The headlight is brighter than the brightest flashlight setting on my iPhone (shown in video). I love the fact that each light came with their own separate charging wire instead of one for both. Definitely a recommend in my book.","Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2021",No Data,1,POSITIVE,0.9921289682388306
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The different flashing options on the light were really nice, the lighting was adequate to navigate a road with some street lights and dark patches at dusk. The light was easy to install but the rubber mount to angle the light on the handlebar kept slipping and the light would not stay steady. It would droop very easily so it practically became useless to keep adjusting that thing. After few weeks of using it, taking the light off of the mount lock became really difficult. The little rail things that lock the light onto the mount kept degrading and while riding on a rough road, the light kept slipping and angling down on the rubber mount. The hard lock eventually just broke and the light fell off the mount onto the road in traffic. Here I am now looking for a new light because within a few weeks of using this light I am again having to buy a new one.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2020",No Data,1,POSITIVE,0.9826242327690125

I thought it might just be stubborn, so I applied some overpressure and it still didn't ""click"" into the clip.  No big deal, or so I thought...About 6 miles into my second ride with the light, I looked down and noticed the holder was empty.  Not what you want to see. I hadn't noticed it fall out (there was a lot of traffic), but knew it had been there when I started.  After retracing my ride, I found the light, but it had already been run over car and smashed.  I was really disappointed and wished I the clip held it in place securely, especially since the light seemed to be bright and lightweight up until that unfortunate moment!

This is bright to be seen, or to use as a flashlight but I noticed the real difference when riding and comparing it to another that very clearly lit the path to where you could see more of the path ahead and surrounding.

I ride sometimes on the streets and neighborhoods, I want to make sure cars see me and Im not an afterthought they didnt see till it was too late.

  Â Pros:Very bright light. We were going on a bike trail and chanced upon some guys with T-shirts from the local expensive bike shop. One of them said to the other as he saw the bright front light, ""not your amazon quality"". I laughed because it was from amazon :)This light shines brighter than the regular brands. see videoI also love that it is USB rechargeable. No worrying about how many batteries it uses.Cons: Over the past year, I have had 4 rear lights and 2 front lights. The rear lights fall off easily because the rubber clip is not secure. I lost two rear lights very quickly. I was attaching them to my bike helmet and backpack to be seen at night, riding to the train station or walking home from the train station.I recently started using the front lights. On the 3rd bike ride, my son fell off his bike and the plastic clip for the front light broke off. See picture.UPDATE:Customer service was excellent and they replaced under warranty. Hence I increased my rating to 4 stars.You should put the light under the seat.","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2020",3 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9879751801490784

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The lights are bright with good battery life.  I like the bracket which allows easy removal for recharging.  The rear light is rechargeable and improves visibility greatly.  It is very light weight and charges very quickly.  One suggestion for the manufacturer is to have 2 different brackets available for mounting these.  The one supplied is great for anything large enough for the rubber band to stretch around, but it would be nice to have another that has a rigid clip instead of the rubber band.  That would allow it to be clipped onto pockets or the loop on my seat pack which would prevent it from bouncing around.  The headlight is balanced a little too far forward so if the band is not tight around whatever it is mounting too, it will tend to tilt forward.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"These lights meet all the qualities of a good bike light...easy-to-install, easy to charge, and certainly seems bright enough. I like that there are different brightness and strobe settings, I like USB charging instead of AAA batteries, and I like how easy it was to install (no tools needed). The only thing I wish it would have would be some indicator of how much battery life is left. I've had these lights installed on my bike for a few months now and rode once in the rain. The lights are still as good as new.UPDATE: I've been using these lights for a number of months and was still satisfied with my purchase. However, I moved the lights to my Mtn bike and during the ride, somehow the front light fell off and I didnt notice it until later. I did find that the front light attachment did not seem too secure as the clip from the light to the mount seemed to not positively engage. I guess the light either worked its way out of the mount due to vibration or I bumped it. Either way, I was sad that the light disappeared. Since I was still satisfied with the ""value"" of the light, I ended up buying another set. This time, I did notice that the front light has a positive 'click' when sliding it into the mount. I guess my first light had a minor manufacturing issue? The other thing I noticed on my first light (before I lost it), was that there is a rubber o-ring around the housing. That o-ring somehow got all stretched out so that it no longer seated tightly into its groove. I took the o-ring off but noticed that it seemed that this rubber gasket is just for aesthetics. the groove it fits into is not a joint as the outer body of the light seemed to be sealed.  I am no 100% sure if that o-ring served a functional purpose, but either way, it no longer fit inside its groove and I removed it. I did not ride in the rain after removing it, so no idea if its removal would create a water-intrusion issue into the light. In any event, this is something I'll keep an eye on for my second light.","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020",2 people found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9901808500289917

Blitzu is plastic case and lighter3. Archer light output is much brighter/stronger  and a warmer color temperature even though both have similar  lumen rating4. Blitzu is easier to slide on/off with simpler tab to disconnect lock tab5. Archer tab release to slide off/on is less ergonomic but still functions. The strap gets in the way of the flange slide - it still works just need to be cognizant that it may need to move out of the way. Nit picky....6. Archer guarantee 18 months vs 12 moths for Blitzu7. Archer water rating is IPX4 vs Blitzu IPX5 which might be better.8. Blitzu recharging port on bottom vs Archer at the rear end. Archer could be recharged without taking off strap, not so for Blitzu unless you rotate the unit so it faces upward. Blitzu port being on bottom might make less prone to water intrusion...perhaps9. Blitzu taillight is CR2032 battery is added expense whereas Archer is rechargeable10.  Archer recharge time is 7 hours - Blitzu is listed as 2.5 hours11. Archer lists light duration/run times twice of Blitzu12. Archer price $17.99; Blitzu now has price reduced to $11.0413. Both rotate horizontally with the Blitzu having a smooth rotation whereas the Archer has click stops.Clearly you get what you pay for and just on brightness output and less operating cost, the Archer for me is the better.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ride just over 20 miles each day on pavement and groomed trails. There are no mountain bike trails but the groomed trails are bumpy in a few places. The mounting attachments for these lights are rubber, designed to make the lights adaptable to more bicycles. The rubber part is a strap with holes that can hook at several lengths depending on the needs of the owner. The large light is probably too heavy and unbalanced for the mounting attachment to be adequate. I lost the front light after about 45 miles but heard it hit the ground and was able to retrieve it. Two days later, the second time it came lose, I didnât see or hear it go. Now itâs gone.These lights are bright enough for commuting in daylight.  I was able to ride 4 hours before a charge on the front light and about 6 hours on the rear light. The light switches are the type that work by cycling through the settings until you hit the one you want. I usually ride with the light set at slow flashing strobe.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"The white light is bright enough. I used it for some nighttime gravel riding in extremely dark conditions in a rural area and it did the job fine.The red light is also fairly bright, though I don't like any of the flashing patterns: I suspect they all would be too annoying for people behind me. The red light comes bundled for free, though, so I guess that's that.Back to the white light: The casing is plastic, which was a bit of a disappointment because I'm used to my good old Teorder aluminium light (which you can't buy anymore as it tends to happen with these transient brands). The plastic on this one feels reasonably sturdy considering the price; but again, my old light wasn't that much more expensive and it felt *leagues* more robust. We'll see how this one holds up after a few months of outdoors use.I'm definitely unhappy with the build, it could do with more careful QA: The light has - or rather, it *should have* - two small indents that latch on the holding bracket to secure the light in place (marked in red in the attached picture). One of these indents wasn't properly cut out, so the light wouldn't sit correctly on the bracket. I had to break off some of the plastic with a screwdriver until eventually the thing more or less sat in place as intended; which is surely not what you want to be doing with a newly bought product, no matter how cheap.The mounting bracket's rubber belt is shorter than I'd like - I have to stretch it uncomfortably around my bike's bars to the point I wonder how long it will hold up before it starts tearing - and the plastic feels way too flimsy for the amount of strength I have to apply to remove the light. I'm fully convinced that this bracket will break one way or the other in the near future. Hopefully it can be replaced with a generic one, but, again, this shouldn't be the kind of thing one is thinking about with a product that's less than a week old.","Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2021",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.9910462498664856

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I seem to be going through front lights like crazy. The weak point is the mini-USB port. I've tossed two lights because they stopped accepting a charging cable after a while. This one seems a bit sturdier. It has four modes: Solid high, solid low, blinking high, and blinking low. Although I don't use it for night riding, when I go through some pedestrian/bike underpasses I can see the light on the walls. It is bright. The taillight is more of a tag-along item. This one has the best USB connector of any I've had and it has a similar choice of four types of light: solid, fast blink, slow blink, irregular blink. It's plenty bright as well. The one thing I don't like is the front mount. It uses a rubber band with holes in it for different diameter handlebars. The perfect setting would be between one that is too loose and one that is too tight. But even the tight one allows the mount to rotate when I remove the light for charging. It is a nuisance, not a deal breaker. So far, this is the best front/back combination light I've had. Did I mention that both lights are rechargeable? A full charge lasts at least 90 minutes, which is my longest ride with it so far. I expect it would go 4 hours easily.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2021",No Data,1,POSITIVE,0.9918045997619629

The rear brake lamp could be brighter, but it does the trick for normal use. My only gripe is the silicone straps that hold on the lights. They are very easy to install and very convenient for taking on and off, but they tend to slide down the frame or handlebar, unlike sturdier more permanent fixtures. My fix for that was to put some self-adhesive stretchy electrical insulation tape around the frame or handlebar to go underneath the silicone straps. That tape sticks very well and it is tacky enough to hold the silicone straps in place better.

  Â The headlight is quite bright and seems to mount securely to the bike handlebar. The flash modes work well too, offering either a medium speed steady blink or a rapid double-blink with a slight pause between flashes.If you are buying this as a combo deal though, I wouldn't recommend it as a great value. The taillight is virtually useless, and frankly one of the weakest I have ever seen. It completely washes out in daylight, and wouldn't stand out much in the dark either.At $20 for the set, you are getting what seems like it might be a pretty decent plastic-bodied headlight and a taillight that I couldn't possibly recommend as providing all but the absolute slimmest margin of additional safety from traffic approaching from the rear of your bike. There are much, MUCH better taillights out there for a reasonable amount of money. This one is better off never getting mounted to your bike.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Itâs always a little uncomfortable buying a half brand/no-name product. I took a chance on these because they were cheap and rechargeable. Once I got them, my mind was blown! The packaging was really well put together, they felt like a namebrand product in the hand. After a quick charge and installing them on my bike (which was quite easy I must add) I took them for a ride.For the price the brightness level totally blew me out of the water. Both front and rear lights stayed Sterley attached to my bike and didnât move at all. There are four settings on both lights, which are pretty nice. I tend to use the full brightness on the headlight and the slow flash on the tail light. Thereâs also a slow flashing mode for the headlight which I use during the day so people driving can see me more easily.Iâve never been able to completely discharge the battery, when I get home after a really long ride Iâll just plug them in and theyâre ready to go for the next time I go riding. Taking them off and reinstalling them is a breeze. Itâs just a rubber belt style mount, which has its pros and cons. If you live in an apartment or a place where you donât want to leave your lights attached to the bike taking them off is a breeze. Just pull on the bell tab and they pop right off. Iâve been on some pretty rough trails and they havenât budged at all when they are installed on the bike. I would say they completely hit it out of the park!I liked this product so much that I bought my mother A pair for her bike as well. Not having to buy batteries is such a huge plus! I donât ride super often at night, but if I did these are so cheap that I would consider buying a second set to have double the brightness level!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This light is fantastic. Brightness is very good, but has 2 levels, and even the lower setting was brighter than 4 other lights we bought, and later returned. Battery life on full power is about 2 hrs, and probably 6-7 hrs on low setting which we use most of the time. Item was shipped fast and received in great condition. The only drawback for me is the Micro USB connector, but I can live with it. I'm ordering a couple extras because I want to to have more for a few years to come. Products change too fast, and go off production... for the price.. seriously order 2!!The red tail light is nice because it too is USB charged, but it's nothing fancy.. just a decent red tail light that can be seen far enough away.","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2020",One person found this helpful,1,POSITIVE,0.986270546913147
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first set of lights for my bike so I can be seen while I'm riding around. For the price, these lights are perfect. The headlights are nice and bright and they do throw the light quite a way. The same can be said for the taillight.However, I have two gripes about them. It says to charge the lights before the first use and the indicators will turn green in about 2-4 hours or less to let you know that it was full. But the headlight never turned green even after charging it for about 4 hours. It still works without issues but I was kinda skeptical of it. And the one-star demerit goes to the clip for the taillight. I never took the taillight off from the mount after charging it but somehow the light fell off the mount. I noticed it was missing during my ride when I reach back to adjust the light setting and it was gone. The strap was still there but the light was gone. It could be possible that the jolting knocked it loose but I'm not sure. I will buy another one just that I will change the orientation of the strap.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was originally pleased with the purchase. Not 100% enamored.  The lights were plenty bright and charged relatively easily and quickly via USB. On a 2011 Carbon fiber frame both front and rear mounts were very snug, yet the front mount continued to slip when the headlamp on it and woul dnot stay focused level ahead.  I was disappointed in the battery life of the headlamp and tried riding with various settings - I see the description now includes some battery life estimates per mode - I have been unable to really get more than 4 hrs of lamp time regardless which mode I use.I was impressed/happy with the rear lamp, seeing 10+ hours of time before it shut off on it's own, which meant I charged the headlamp each ride and the tail lamp every other ride.  Despite the shortcomings I would have still rated it a 5 star for the value.11 months from my order date exactly, the rear lamp fell off; the mount's plastic tab broke off completely. Combined with the front mount no longer securely holding the lamp (it doesn't ""lock in"") which started a month or two ago I am now not only much less satisfied, but left without a way to mount the rear light entirely.  It seems any warranty is about 6 months, but I will try to contact Seller anyway.  If no solution (or resolution) I will likely shop for another make, modle, brand, etc possibly with a velcro strap mounting option.","Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2021",No Data,1,POSITIVE,0.991746187210083

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Although I found this product initially adequate, I rate it a 2 out of 5 stars.The headlight is okay, but it is a narrow beam of light and I wish I would have selected something with more lumens.  The headlight on this unit has 400 lumens and is adequate if there is secondary light around (e.g. street lights, stores, etc.).  Where I ride is VERY dark.  Hence, I believe after having used this headlight, I need at least double or triple the lumens (maybe 800-1,200).  Buyer beware on claimed lumenocity though.  Some good 400 lumen units are as bright (or brighter) than some claiming 800, 1,200, 2,500, plus.As for the taillight, it stopped taking a charge after 2.5 months.  I plugged it in after nearly every ride, and very recently it just didn't charge anymore.  For only $14 (what I paid in late 2020), this set gets a mere ""meh"" from me.I will be replacing this set with something brighter and that has better charging durability.  Would be nice if the company/manufacturer of this set were to reach out to me and offer a replacement.  Better yet, make the batteries removable so that when the cheap, Chinese batteries fail, we can put our own rechargeable batteries in this instead of throwing it away.","Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2021",No Data,1,POSITIVE,0.9925625920295715

I got it for those early morning rides, but this time it was bright enough outside I didn't even end up using it. Seemed like it had solid brightness, but the mount is just too weak (a very simple plastic clip). I actually liked how easy it was to install/remove the mount from the handlebars, thinking I could use this for early morning mountain bike rides as well, but there's no way it would have survived the bumpiness of a mountain trail because the clip isn't solid enough to hold it in place.

It frustrates her to the point where she'd rather throw it in her backpack rather than reattach it back. Which means she's biking in the dark dangerously.

Never ran out during a ride unless I didn't charge it beforehand. Also used in rain and had no issues.The bad: The headlight actually slips downward when going over rough surfaces, which leads to having to constantly adjust it. Pretty frustrating to have to deal with, but solved by putting a little bit of grip tape on my handlebar where I mount it at. The worst part though is all it took was the bike tipping over once for the rubber to break on the headlight. I didn't wreck. The bike was propped up and my kid accidentally knocked it over.I came here in hopes of buying a replacement part for it since it comes in 2 parts and the light itself is fine.

You can find brighter ones but they're significantly more expensive.**********************Details*****Was caught unawares when riding the other day and the darkness set in real fast on this trail I was on. I had no light and was barely able to see. I was just dinging my bell in the hopes that people could hear it and I would be fine. Decided to prioritize getting the lights as soon as I got home, and they were delivered the next morning at 7 am, fast!Installation was super easy, you just loop the strap around your handlebar like you're putting on a watch or a belt, and then hook it into the hook. It stays secure even on the bumps. Same for the rear light. I mounted my power bank onto my handlebar using velcro tape and used that to recharge my light (and phone) while biking in daytime. It arrived with decent charge and didn't need that much extra charging, but I was just trying to be careful.The light has 2 brightness settings: full brightness (300 lumens), and half brightness (150 lumens). It also includes two strobe settings: slow and fast. The half brightness was good for when it was just early darkness, just prior dusk, and then full brightness was needed after dusk in the wooded unlit areas.I posted a picture of the light at full brightness, half brightness, and off. I used my Sony a7III that I carried with me for photography and took all photos at the same settings, so there's no cheating the exposures. What you see in that photo is the actual difference between the brightness levels (and off). It's decently bright. I could see the reflectors on the unlit biker coming the other direction in pitch darkness. The light doesn't carry too far though, so it's more for immediate vicinity and for other people toWorth it for the price, and would definitely recommend. Will edit this post after I've had more time with the light if there are any issues that come up.","Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2021",No Data,1,POSITIVE,0.9932644367218018

No issues on the rear strobe, just the front.Got these for my road bike to replace some old battery operated lights.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I misplaced my son's bike lights last year and I can't find the same ones being sold anymore, so I bought this set to try out.  We use bike lights when camping because our kids are often riding campground loops during and after sunset.  By the time I charged them up to use for camping this summer, the Amazon return window was closed and I found that the back red light would not work after charging.  I contacted the company directly, they tried troubleshooting first.  When that did not work, they replaced the light.  I can't speak for long term durability yet, but the front light is much much brighter than my old one, and also bigger / bulkier.  I was initially turned off by the bulkier size because I use the lights on small kids bikes, but I don't have any real reason to take issue with it, I guess.  Customer service was fantastic when I found that my one light not working.  Communication was quick and easy.
